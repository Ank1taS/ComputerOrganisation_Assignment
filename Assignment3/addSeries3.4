	; In this program 1000H address stores the size of array ie total numbers in the series
	; 1001H, 1002H, 1003H, 1004H stores 5, 10, 5, 20 respectively
 

	LXI	H,	1001H   ; HL register pair stores 1001H address value ie value
	MOV	B,	H	; address of HL copied to BC register
	MOV	C,	L
	MVI	H,	00H
	MVI	L,	00H

LOOP:	LDAX	B		; value at the address of B is copied to A
	MOV	E,	A	; value at A is copied to E
	DAD	D		; HL += DE
	LDA	1000H		; value at 0th index copied to A ie array size
	DCR	A
	STA	1000H
	INX	B		; BC register points to next address
	JNZ 	LOOP	
	;result is at HL register pair
